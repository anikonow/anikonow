Work on this topic was published by Alex Nikonowicz 
- CPP: contains code to run CPP in MATLAB; onsite_riskawareplanner (to be used onsite), sim_riskawareplanner (simulation risk aware planner) (most up to date versions)
other code or pathplanners in this folder are older versions, have specific use cases (resampling onsite data) or are supplementary functions for CPP
-Results: contains pdf examples of completed CPP and decomposition
-Risk: contains risk calulations, USV sim models, and other toy code


Standalone

Contains files related to stand alone USV projects
Arduino DCU, Custom UNCC USV, sensor NEMA string collection and parser

Test Data

Contains raw USV data (depth, GNSS, and .log) from several tests preformed by Hydrone
Data: contains data from each tests (refer to readme.txt in data folder for more info)
plotting: contains .m code for data analysis of different tests
Quarter data: contains .m code for data analysis of hydrone performance
